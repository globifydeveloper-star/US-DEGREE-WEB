/**
 * Forces every route under this layout to render at request time.
 *
 * Required by the nonce-based CSP in src/proxy.ts: Next.js stamps the nonce
 * onto script tags during SSR, reading it from the request's CSP header. A
 * page prerendered at build time has no request and therefore no nonce, so its
 * script tags would fail the 'strict-dynamic' policy and the browser would
 * block the entire bundle. Forcing dynamic rendering here (rather than in each
 * page) covers the three client-component pages, which cannot use route
 * segment config.
 *
 * Cost: static optimisation and CDN edge caching are disabled app-wide. That
 * is the documented trade-off for nonce-based CSP.
